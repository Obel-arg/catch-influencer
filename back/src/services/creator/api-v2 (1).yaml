                                title: One year of consistent yoga. I’m really amazed at how far I’ve come and I have loved every moment of it. It has been challenging but so rewarding. I feel stronger and more fit than I have in my entire life and I am doing things that I never thought I’d be able to do. I’m more mindful and aware of my breath throughout the day and I would say that this practice has improved every aspect of my life. This is pretty cool.

                                title: One year of consistent yoga. I’m really amazed at how far I’ve come and I have loved every moment of it. It has been challenging but so rewarding. I feel stronger and more fit than I have in my entire life and I am doing things that I never thought I’d be able to do. I’m more mindful and aware of my breath throughout the day and I would say that this practice has improved every aspect of my life. This is pretty cool.

                          Community Values

                          We believe people can do more together than alone and that each of us plays an important role in helping to create a safe and respectful community. So, we’ve laid out a set of principles for us to follow on this Page:

                          Let’s celebrate the things that bring us together.

                          Let’s choose to treat each other like neighbors rather than strangers.

                          Let’s respect individuality and welcome diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

                          Let’s assume people mean well.

                          Our moderators are here for the community to uphold these values every day.

                          Community Values

                          We believe people can do more together than alone and that each of us plays an important role in helping to create a safe and respectful community. So, we’ve laid out a set of principles for us to follow on this Page:

                          Let’s celebrate the things that bring us together.

                          Let’s choose to treat each other like neighbors rather than strangers.

                          Let’s respect individuality and welcome diverse backgrounds and perspectives.

                          Let’s assume people mean well.

                          Our moderators are here for the community to uphold these values every day.
